I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Korea University**, advised by Prof. Yoonsuh Jung.  
My research interests focus on **quantile regression, variable selection, and uncertainty quantification**.  
I am particularly interested in developing new statistical methodologies and machine learning approaches that provide robust inference and reliable prediction under complex data settings.
